# Dementia Risk Factor Analysis (EDA)

This project performs detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a synthetic clinical dataset to identify potential lifestyle, demographic, and health-related risk factors associated with Alzheimer's Disease.

## 🔍 Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing of health indicators and lifestyle variables
- Visualization of relationships between risk factors and Alzheimer's diagnosis
- Correlation heatmap and T-tests for statistical validation
- Identification of top contributing features (e.g., age, BMI, sleep quality)

## 📊 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- SciPy (for statistical tests)

## 📁 Dataset
- CSV file: `dementia-excel.csv`
- Includes 20+ variables: age, gender, BMI, physical activity, diabetes, smoking status, APOE-ε4 allele, etc.

## 💡 Visual Insights
- Box plots and bar charts comparing diagnosed vs non-diagnosed individuals
- Correlation heatmap for all numerical and encoded categorical variables
- T-test results for statistically significant differences in numeric variables

## 🧠 Goal
Help uncover potential modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors for dementia using EDA.
